===

## Kickoff
* Welcome to campus and to being a developer!
* Intros
* Share Code Fellows Vision and Mission
* Share facility information
* Events, social accounts, 

## Student 401 Expectations:
* Assignments/Grading
* Emphasis on Refactoring and Code Improvement
* Trade-off decisions over right/wrong
* “Growth Mindset” Learning
* Uphold Code of Conduct

## Course Overview
* 10 week overview

## This week JavaScript
* By Ref vs By Val
	* basic memory concepts
* Functions
	* as objects
	* closures
	* “this”
	* bind, call, apply
* Objects
	* Prototypical inheritance
	* constructor functions vs Object.create
	* ES6 “class”
	* Revealing Module pattern
	* Object Literals
* Array Methods
	* “Functional” - forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc.
	* “modifying” - sort, length, etc.
	* Chaining 
	* ES6 fat arrow ftw!
* Javascript Literals
	* Object
	* Array
	* Regex
	* string, number, bool, hex, ...

## Today's Learning Objectives
* Setup and run JavaScript “app” using Node.js from command line
	* v6
	* ES6 FTW!
* Logically organize and split code into modules (.js files) 
using require and module.exports to share code between modules 
(we'll cover import and export in second half of course) 
* Setup, run, and watch (continuously run) tests using Mocha and Chai
* Use tests and assertions to validate and maintain correctness of code
