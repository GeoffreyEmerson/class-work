## Learning Objectives

1. Explain the scaling characteristics (graph shape) and give examples of 
`O(1)`, `O(log n)`, `O(n)`, `O(n^2)`, and `O(2^n)` 
complexity functions.
2. Evaluate existing code to determine Big O in time or space
3. Understand differences and uses of arrays and dictionaries (hashes)
4. Learn how-to whiteboard and "why"

## Agenda

* After Code Fellows, entering job search phase
* ~~Whiteboarding~~ Demonstrative skills
	* Good 
	* Bad - low correlation, no tracking false negatives 
	* Ugly - enforces biases
* Let's mine good whiteboard skills to make you a more attractive candidate
